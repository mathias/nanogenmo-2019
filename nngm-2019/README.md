My Nano-Nanogenmo 2019
======================

A rewrite of Thoreau's Walden using word substitutions. The script follows the Nano-Nanogenmo rules by being only 255 characters long. 

```
$ wc -c pwReplace.rb 
254 pwReplace.rb
```

The Gutenberg text (which downloads as 205-0.txt) must be piped in:

```
$ cat 205-0.txt | ruby pwReplace.rb > output.txt
```
The output is checked in at `output.txt` in this directory. It is plenty long for our minimum of 50K words:

```
$ wc -w output.txt 
115770 output.txt
```

Sample output:
